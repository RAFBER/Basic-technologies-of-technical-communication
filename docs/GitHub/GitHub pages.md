Just the Docs is a template that tells Jekyll how the site should be generated.  
In order for a site to be generated by Jekyll using the Just the Docs template, you have to copy the Just the Docs template into your account on the GitHub server.

## Files structure

**Important:** In order for a page to be generated by Jekyll using the Just the Docs template, files must be placed in a repository according to a schema defined by just-the-docs.

In order for the site to be generated properly, the files structure must look as follows: 

   ![Files structure](../assets/images/Files_structure.svg)
   *Fig.1-2: Basic configuration of the files structure in the repository to publish the web sites using just-the-docs template*

### Configuration file

* The _config.yml file is a configuration file for the Jekyll generator. The _config.yml file should look like this:  
**Note:** Explanations for each command are given in parentheses.

### Markdown files - the main rules

**Note:** Each Markdown file (.md) must start with Jekyll code to be displayed using the just-the-docs template.

* index.md file in the root level

   ![GitHub pages](../assets/images/GitHub_pages_14.png)

* Markdown files in docs folder

   ![GitHub pages](../assets/images/GitHub_pages_15.png)

* index.md file in folder of the chapter 

   ![GitHub pages](../assets/images/GitHub_pages_16.png)

* Markdown files in the folder of chapter (parent folder)

   ![GitHub pages](../assets/images/GitHub_pages_17.png)


### Pictures

* Place in the pictures always in the assets / images folder.
* If the files structure is multi-level, the assets / images folder must always be on the "Parent" folder level to render the pictures correctly also in "Children" files.

## Publication

After adding the files to the repository according to the just-the-docs template, you can publish your website.  
The procedure for publishing pages according to the just-the-docs template is the same as for publishing pages without using the just-the-docs template and is described above in chapter *Publication the web sites from the GitHub Pages repository*.
