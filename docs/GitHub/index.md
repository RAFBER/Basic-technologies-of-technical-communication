# What is GitHub?
* GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

* It was created by Linus Torvalds.  
* The files "live" locally on our computer, and their copy on
the GitHub server, from where we can share them with other GitHub users.
* If we work in a group, everyone can have their own files version called **branch**, which it can then incorporate into a shared version (operation joining is called **merge**). Branches are also useful for solo work, when we're working on a draft version and then we include it in the official version.
