The general idea of work with branches in GitHub is that the developer makes some changes does not make changes to the main branch but into his branch. Then the changes are committed and merged into the main branch.  
The developer works without ane affect to main code base.  
The great advantage of such work is that the main code base is error-free because changes to the main code base are merged only after approval by the editor.  
Use a branch always if you would like to isolate your work without affecting to other branches in the repository.
