# GitHub branches - main idea

The main idea of the work with *Branches* in GitHub is that all feature development take place in dedicated branch instead of the main branch.  


 This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main code base. It also means the master branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.
